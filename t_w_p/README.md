# test_wikipedia_post
This module is a demo of Python Selenium testing two pages on Wikipedia. 

The test involves opening the first page by URL, asserting that expected values are on the page (header), searching for another page, and finally asserting that expected values are on that page as well.

This module represents only a basic demo of Selenium's capabilities. A full testing suite would be based on complete business requirements, a testing framework (pytest), and documented test cases. 

Written for Python 3.9.9
